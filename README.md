# Rovers

This was a surprisingly fun excercise.

I wasn't able to get the same output as provided under "Sample Output" in the
exercise spec. It's very possible I'm missing something but without the benefit
of a second pair of eyes I haven't spotted it. I'm going to take the title
literally, "sample output" and not "expected output".

## Installation & Usage

Nothing special is required to run this, just Python 3.6+. Ensure that the
`rovers.py` script is executable:

```
[~/rovers]$ chmod +x ./rovers.py
```

Execute the script directly:

```
[~/rovers]$ ./rovers.py
```

## Tests

Test are a standard pytest-style suite.

```
[~/rovers]$ pytest
```
